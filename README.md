This is project which I did for my education in New Bulgarian University.
It handles Java and specificly hibernate application which did make requests to the database. 
My task was to create an 'Electronic Property Manager' application for use by companies providing
professional property maintenance services in multifamily buildings. Each building has apartments 
located on specific floors, each with characteristics such as apartment number, area, owner, 
and occupants. Maintenance fees for each property are determined based on the apartment's size,
an additional amount per occupant over 7 years old who uses the elevator, and an added fee if there's a
pet using common areas. Residents in the building collectively pay these fees monthly. 
Each building is serviced by one employee from the contracting company, initially assigned
to the employee with the fewest assigned buildings. When an employee with assigned buildings leaves,
their buildings are redistributed among the remaining employees.
